Progress  4/24/25
	Right now, I have finished my week 1 implementation goals and have set up the basic foundation and structure for my calculator. It can solve basic equations involving the +, -, *, and / operators.
	So far there haven’t been any hurdles to jump. There have only been a couple of instances where I’ve had to search online for solutions to questions or issues I’ve had during development. 
  I believe the hardest thing was getting my code linked to my github correctly. The process was tedious because I believe I made a mistake halfway through the process and had to go back and search for my error.
	My next steps for my project is to add logarithmic and trigonometric functions to my calculator. I don’t believe this will be too hard since I’ve become more familiar with my code and I’ve tried to make it a module.
  I’m hoping to get ahead of schedule and also add some error handling as well.
